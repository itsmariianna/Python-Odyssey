# Create a function named my_filter that behaves like Pythonâ€™s built-in filter() function. It should filter items out of an iterable based on a function that returns either True or False and return a list of the filtered items.
# Requirements:
# Return a list of filtered items instead of using a generator.
# Include type annotations and a detailed docstring.
# Avoid using the built-in filter() in your implementation.

def my_filter(function, iterable):

    """
    Filter items from an iterable based on a function that returns True or False.

    Parameters:
    func: A function that takes an element and returns a boolean value.
    iterable: An iterable containing elements.

    Returns:
    List: A list of items from the iterable for which the function returns True.
